          place 🤔 . This month&apos;s theme will be Pop :boom: . Using bright,
          flamboyant colors 🌈 , create a piece around a remarkable object,
          activity, or event. We&apos;d love to get submissions in every
          artistic category: visual arts, writing, theater, public speaking, and
          dance! You&apos;re welcome to submit videos, paintings, graphics, and
          all other mediums through which you can represent the theme!
          <br />
          Submit your artwork here: https://forms.gle/zwY27gKGV6Bro68W8. The
          last day to submit your piece is June 18. We will be featuring your
          work on open.fiveable.me, Fiveable&apos;s Open Source Website, a place
          for all students to view your amazing talent. 🥳
